# E-Commerce_Back_End

## Description
In this exploration I developed a backend data base for normal retail store where the owner can add edit and remove items its content. It does this by having seperating the information along differnt blocks to be called on when needed. For example if the owners needs a new category with only Outdoor items then all the products assosiated with the category would be the same and could be called on seperate from th rest. As well a lot of there features explained in the video link in this project.
